          p The State Library of New South Wales' digital collections are growing rapidly; millions of books and records, available for unprecedented access online. 
          p Those books didn't digitise themselves. 
          p Behind every exciting interface to a digital collection, there are countless librarians, archivists, preservation specialists and contractors. Following the State Library's current best practices, these staff members carefully photograph millions of pages of collection material each year, cataloguing the resulting files within a complex, interconnected infrastructure of systems.
